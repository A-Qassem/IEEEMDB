 For the Movies table i would create a B+ Tree index on the title column,
 this will optimize search queries when users type a movie name.

For the Reviews table I would index on movie id so we can quickly fetch all reviews for a specific movie

I chose B+ Trees specifically because they are efficient for both equality and range queries.
